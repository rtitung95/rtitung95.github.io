## Background
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. from the Rochester Institute of Technology in the Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences at [Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing Lab](https://www.rit.edu/clasp/). My primary supervisor is Professor [Masayuki Tanaka](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/~mtanaka/), and I am working closely with Professor [Masatoshi Okutomi](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/mem/mxo/okutomi.html). 

Additionally, I work at Woven Planet Holdings as a Data Scientist, where I am part of the Self-Driving Recognition/Perception AD/ADAS team. At Woven, I work on research problems related to few-shot object detection, scene tags image classification, and road marking recognition. Previously I used to work at Rakuten ([Rakuten Institute of Technology](https://rit.rakuten.co.jp/)  - R&D Dept) as a Research Scientist for 3.5 years, where I used deep learning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning to solve computer vision, finance, cybersecurity, and e-commerce related research problems. In Rakuten, I worked under the supervision of [Bjorn Stenger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=plhjgHUAAAAJ&hl=en),  [Bruno Charron](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=klbU-o4AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Mitsuru Nakazawa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TLQD7yUAAAAJ&hl=ja). During my master's, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. James Wolf](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/James-R.-Wolf/2543949) for my master's project.

## Research Projects at Woven Planet

- **Scene Tags Classification**: Design and develop a production model for the classification of scenes for a wide variety of scenarios based on weather, road type, parking, road structures, traffic conditions, intersections, and so on with macro-f1: 0.65 and micro-f1:0.75 for around 100 classes.

- **Few-shot object detection**: Design and develop a few-shot object detection method based on CenterNet architecture to improve the performance of the production model on long-tail distribution objects such as ambulances, bikes, and kickboards based on the images of fish-eye lens cameras.
 
- **Road Marking Recognition**: Developed a production model trained on Japanese/English text images to predict paint on streets/roads for self-driving vehicles using the backbone of the CRNN text recognition model with 99% word accuracy and ~0.2 msec latency on a synthetic dataset.

## Research Projects at Rakuten

- **Continuous Taxonomy Learning**: Develop a lifelong continual learning system for change in the hierarchy of images over time by utilizing recurrent neural networks, GCN, and lifelong learning methods based on hierarchical classification loss functions while baselining the results on Open Images v6 dataset.

- **Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits**: Develop a contextual bandit model to optimize Ad banners on Rakuten e-commerce website for tens of millions of users based on users’ historical purchase data and historical interactions with banners. Write production code to be used in real-time low latency application and performed thorough testing.

- **Anomaly Detection in Security**: Develop a user and entity analysis (UEBA) tool using clustering and multi-modal (CNN & LSTM) learning to detect malware and anomalies in tens of thousands of Rakuten employee’s terminals from network text logs.

- **Credit Scoring**: Increased the approval rate of credit card merchant customers by 5% by developing a credibility scoring model and segmentation of merchants that led to an increase in revenue of millions of dollars. Lead a team of engineers for the backend development and design different system architecture diagrams.

- **Market Trading**: Gained more than 7% ROI / year in daily trading of products such as forex currency pairs, bonds, and indexes by developing end-to-end machine learning models (LSTM & Traditional ML) based on historical market macroeconomics data for assets under management (AUM) of tens of millions of dollars.
