# Background
---
I am a Computing and Information Sciences Ph.D. candidate at Rochester Institute of Technology, working with Professor [Cecilia O. Alm](https://www.rit.edu/clasp/directory/coagla-cecilia-alm) in the [Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing Lab (CLaSP)](https://www.rit.edu/clasp/). My research focuses on interactive machine learning and federated learning for multimodal affective computing.
<br/><br/>

# Research Interests
---
My research interests include multimodal machine learning, interactive machine learning, affective computing, natural language/speech processing, personalized federated learning, and Reinforcement Learning for human behavioral modeling.
